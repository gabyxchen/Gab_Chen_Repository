The department is considering implementing an algorithmic system to identify communities that should receive priority for social service funding and outreach programs. Your supervisor has asked you to evaluate the quality and reliability of available census data to inform this decision.\n\nDrawing on our Week 2 discussion of algorithmic bias, you need to assess not just what the data shows, but how reliable it is and what communities might be affected by data quality issues.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n- Apply dplyr functions to real census data for policy analysis\n- Evaluate data quality using margins of error \n- Connect technical analysis to algorithmic decision-making\n- Identify potential equity implications of data reliability issues\n- Create professional documentation for policy stakeholders\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n**Submit by posting your updated portfolio link on Canvas.** Your assignment should be accessible at `your-portfolio-url/labs/lab_1/`\n\nMake sure to update your `_quarto.yml` navigation to include this assignment under an \"Labs\" menu.\n\n# Part 1: Portfolio Integration\n\nCreate this assignment in your portfolio repository under an `labs/lab_1/` folder structure.

This could lead to misallocation of resources or misclassification in models used for funding, eligibility, or planning. Higher uncertainty in these counties is likely driven by small populations, rural characteristics, and limited survey samples, which increase margins of error in ACS estimates.]\n\n\n# Part 3: Neighborhood-Level Analysis\n\n## 3.1 Focus Area Selection\n\n**Your Task:** Select 2-3 counties from your reliability analysis for detailed tract-level study.\n\n**Strategy:** Choose counties that represent different reliability levels (e.g., 1 high confidence, 1 moderate, 1 low confidence) to compare how data quality varies.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Use filter() to select 2-3 counties from your county_reliability data\n# Store the selected counties in a variable called selected_counties\nselected_counties <- pa_reliability %>%\n  group_by(reliability) %>%\n  slice(1)\n\n# Display the selected counties with their key characteristics\n# Show: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\nprint(selected_counties) %>%\nselect(county_name, medincE, moe_percentage, reliability)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 9\n# Groups:   reliability [2]\n  GEOID NAME          totpopE totpopM medincE medincM county_name moe_percentage\n  <chr> <chr>           <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>                <dbl>\n1 42001 Adams County…  104604      NA   78975    3334 Adams                 4.22\n2 42023 Cameron Coun…    4536      NA   46186    2605 Cameron               5.64\n# ℹ 1 more variable: reliability <chr>\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n# Groups:   reliability [2]\n  county_name medincE moe_percentage reliability    \n  <chr>         <dbl>          <dbl> <chr>          \n1 Adams         78975           4.22 High Confidence\n2 Cameron       46186           5.64 Moderate       \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Comment on the output:** [Using filter() to select a certain number of observations requires you to have a basic understanding of your data frame.One county with the highest MOE percentage is selected from each reliability group.]\n\n## 3.2 Tract-Level Demographics\n\n**Your Task:** Get demographic data for census tracts in your selected counties.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Geography: tract level\n- Variables: white alone (B03002_003), Black/African American (B03002_004), Hispanic/Latino (B03002_012), total population (B03002_001)\n- Use the same state and year as before\n- Output format: wide\n- **Challenge:** You'll need county codes, not names.

of black and hispanic or latino population. Tracts with smaller population size have smaller survey samples. More homogeneous tracts have limited variation across demographic categories. Both of the cases increase statistical uncertainty and inflate margins of error.]\n\n\n# Part 5: Policy Recommendations\n\n## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\n\n**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\n\n**Executive Summary Requirements:**\n1. **Overall Pattern Identification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?\n2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?\n3. **Root Cause Analysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?\n4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\n[Across the analysis of census data reliability at county levels in Pennsylvania, approximately 85% of the state’s 67 counties have a margin of error below 5% (“High Confidence”). Approximately 15% of all counties have a margin of error between 5% to 10% (“Moderate”).No county exhibits a margin of error exceeding 10% (“Low Confidence”), indicating that median income estimates at the county level are generally reliable. \nOne county was selected from each MOE reliability category to conduct a tract-level analysis of data reliability. Examining the margins of error associated with racial population shares at the census tract level reveals that many tracts in Pennsylvania experience some degree of MOE-related data quality issues. On average, tracts with higher MOE issues tend to have larger population sizes and more racially homogeneous compositions, characterized by a higher proportion of White residents and smaller shares of Black and Hispanic or Latino populations.\nThese patterns suggest that higher MOE issues are driven by both total population size and the interaction between survey sampling limitations and small subgroup populations, particularly in racially homogeneous tracts. When using census data to inform policy decisions, special care should be taken in interpreting estimates for these communities to avoid introducing statistical bias into policy design and implementation:\nTo address systematic MOE issues, the Department should integrate data quality metrics directly into analytic and algorithmic workflows, particularly for tract-level decision-making.

In these counties, median income estimates are statistically reliable, reducing the risk that automated systems will misallocate resources or misclassify need. Algorithms applied in these contexts can be expected to perform consistently, provided routine validation checks remain in place. (Adams, Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Bedford, etc.)]\n\n2. **Counties requiring additional oversight:** [Counties with Moderate Confidence data should be included in algorithmic workflows but paired with active monitoring and evaluation. In these areas, algorithmic outputs should be reviewed periodically against observed outcomes to detect potential bias or instability. Incorporating performance audits or sensitivity checks can help ensure that moderate data uncertainty does not translate into systematic policy errors. (Forest, Greene, Elk, Cameron, Carbon, etc.)]\n\n3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:** [Counties identified as Low Confidence require alternative approaches due to high margins of error and limited data reliability. For these counties, algorithmic outputs should not be used as the sole basis for decision-making. Instead, the Department should rely on manual review, aggregated or multi-year data, supplemental administrative records, or targeted local surveys to inform policy decisions and reduce the risk of statistical bias.]\n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\n\n1. How do MOE patterns vary spatially across Pennsylvania, and are high-uncertainty tracts geographically clustered in rural, suburban, or peripheral urban areas?\n2. How do margins of error change over time, and are certain counties or tracts becoming more or less reliable?\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on 2026-02-10\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version 4.5.2\n- Census API key required for replication\n- Complete code and documentation available at: https://gabyxchen.github.io/PPA_Portfolio/\n\n**Methodology Notes:**\n[Adams and Cameron Counties were randomly selected for detailed demographic analysis to represent their respective MOE risk categories, although this selection may introduce elements of randomness that could influence the results.]\n\n**Limitations:**\n[Only one sample county was selected from each MOE risk category group, and the small sample size may limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, this analysis relies solely on 2022 ACS 5-year estimates, which capture conditions within a single time period. As a result, the study does not account for temporal variation or longer-term trends in demographic patterns and data reliability.]\n\n---\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [ ] All code chunks run without errors\n- [ ] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [ ] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [ ] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [ ] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [ ] Census API key is properly set \n- [ ] Document renders correctly to HTML\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.
